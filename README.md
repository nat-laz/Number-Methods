# Number-Methods

There are many JavaScript Number methods that are often used to manipulate number values. These number formats support integers, floating-point numbers, such as decimal, hexadecimal, notations.

Here are a few methods that can make manipulating and modifying numeric values much easier.

-  _Number()_  - method converts a string into a number.

  - _ParseInt()_ - very similar to the number() method, parseInt() formats a string into an integer.

-  _ParseFloat()_ - method parses a string value and returns the number with its decimal value.

- _.toString()_ - method converts a numeric value into a string.

- _.toExponential()_ - converts a number into a string and returns it in an exponential format.

- _toFixed()_ - method rounds up a number to the nearest highest or lowest fixed-point notation.

- _.toPrecision()_ -  returns the numeric value with a specific length. It takes an argument that signifies the length. If given without a specific length, the method returns the number as it is.

- _valueOf()_ - method is used to return the primitive value of the Number object youâ€™re calling it on. Primitive types in JavaScript are number, string, bigint, symbol, undefined, null, and boolean.

- _toLocaleString()_ - method uses a local language format to convert a number and returns it as a string. It takes two arguments, locales and options , which defines the language of which conversion you want to use, and the behavior of the function.

- _.isInteger()_ -  checks whether the given value is an integer and returns a boolean value.
